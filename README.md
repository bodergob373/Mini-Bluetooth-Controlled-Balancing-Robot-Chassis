# Electric-Doohickey

**NOTE:**  I know this submission is really late, but I'm still confident I can finish this. I have almost all the parts I need so I just need to build it. I already have decent welding and soldering skills, and I spent a while making detailed plans and doing research so that things would go smoothly.

## Description
A BMS with an array of 20 2nd-Gen Nissan Leaf battery modules in a 10s2p configuration connected to a motor controller and a 12kW 72V hub motor all placed in a small custom go-kart. The wheels are in a diamond configuration with one steerable wheel, one powered rear wheel, and two stabilizing wheels.

## Why?
My main goal for the future is to build an ethanol-electric hybrid car from scratch. To do this, I need real-world experience designing electrical and mechanical stuff and more practice welding. I'm making this project so that I can design the electric part of the hybrid car and test it on a small, fast, and fun vehicle with only half the number of batteries, motor controllers, and motors.
